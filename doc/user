Tanktastic-o user's manual
==========================

Info
====
    Tanktastic-o is a 2D multiplayer game of tanks, where the players try
    to achieve the highest score possible by killing their enemies and
    surviving at the same time (death cancels their score).

Installation
============
    For the simplicity of the installation, an install script was included and
    can be used by simply typing "./install.sh" in the main directory.
    This script will generate the makefiles for the SFML library, compile
    the library and then compile the game.

Controls
========
    W -     Movement up.
    S -     Movement down.
    A -     Movement left.
    D -     Movement right.
    Space - Shoot.

Requirements
============
    g++ compiler (for SFML)
    clang++ compiler (for the game, can be easily changed in the makefile, by
                      changing the variable CC to g++)

Running a server
================
    The server can be run by typing the command "./run -s" in the main
    directory, the user will be then prompted to enter the IP address and the
    port that the server will listen on. For simplicity, you can use "public"
    for the machines public address, "local" for the machines local address,
    "lh" or "localhost" for 127.0.0.1 (for testing).
    After you select the address and port, the server starts running and can be
    stopped by SIGINT (Ctr-c), closing the terminal window or shutting down
    the machine it's running on.

Starting up the client
======================
    The client can be started by typing the command "./run -c" in the main
    directory, this will prompt the user to enter an address and a port
    where the server is located and listening, then the player's name.
    Note: The address and the port will be provided by the server once it
    is started, so either copy them or ask the server maintainer for
    the connection information.
    Note: If one of the clients is on a same machine as the server, simply
    using "public" will suffice. (or localhost for testing)
