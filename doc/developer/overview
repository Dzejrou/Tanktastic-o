Tanktastic-o developer's documentation
======================================
    Tanktastic-o is a 2D multiplayer game where the players control tanks and
    try to destroy each other.
    The communication between clients is done through a custom binary
    protocol (see protocol documentation) with the server acting as a middle
    man.
    The game can be normally played by up to 4 players, but higher number
    of players can be achieved by changing the MAX_PLR macro in the files
    Client.hpp and Server.hpp (note: there are only 4 sprites!).

Technology
==========
    The game is created using C++ and the SFML library (sfml-dev.org) which
    is used for gaphics rendering and network communication.
    The target platform is Linux, but porting the game to Windows or OS X
    should require minimal effort.

Game
====
    The game's logic is done on the client side, every client, in his game
    loop, processes the player's input, handles packets from server, updates
    its tank and other player's tanks and renders everything to the game
    window. To protect the players from lag and slower hardware, the server
    periodically does a movement correction, in which it's sends all the
    player positions to the players, which might on slower machines or
    connections result in a small amount of stuttering, but will ensure
    that the data are synchronized across the players and the server isn't
    under too much pressure.
    Any messages sent by the players are filtered by the server, which updates
    the positions to be later sent/disconnects the player/etc and then
    resends them to all other players.

About this documentation
========================
    Except for this file, there are documentation files for each of the
    classes. In these files, you will find basic information about the class,
    it's API reference (methods with parameter types, parameter description and
    it's purpose) and the list of all class member variables.
    Installation steps can be found in the "user" file in the parent directory.
    Aside from these files, most of the task performed by any of these classes
    is documented by the abundant comments spread across them.
